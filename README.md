This code can be used to generate simulations similar to Fig. 2 in the following paper:

Virginia Bordignon, Stefan Vlaski, Vincenzo Matta, and Ali H. Sayed,  "Network Classifiers Based on Social Learning,'' in Proc. IEEE ICASSP, Toronto, Canada, May 2021. [![DOI:10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9414126](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9414126.svg)](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP39728.2021.9414126)

The three panels in Fig. 2 are generated executing file 'main.py'.

Please note that the code is not generally perfected for performance, but is rather meant to illustrate certain results from the paper. The code is provided as-is without guarantees.
